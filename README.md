## 🔄Version Control

This project uses Git and GitHub for version control, implementing a multirepo structure. The project is divided into three separate repositories:

1. Frontend Repository: `coworkingAppFrontend`

2. Backend Repository: `coworkingAppBackend`

3. DevOps Repository: `coworkingAppDevOps`

Each repository is managed independently, allowing for separate versioning and development cycles. This structure provides flexibility and clear separation of concerns between different parts of the application.
